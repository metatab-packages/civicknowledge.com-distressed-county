# Distressed Tracts Per County

The [FFEIC publishes a very large dataset of Census
variables](https://www.ffiec.gov/censusapp.htm) and flags indicating ways in
which housing and populations in tracts are distressed. This dataset aggregates
those tract flags into counts of distressed tracts per county.
